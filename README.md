### Question 2

**Dynamic power:** CPU 's logic gates are responsible for dynamic power consumption due to their activation.As the logic gates are toogling, energy flows while the capacitors inside them charge and discharge.Dynamic power is equal to:

C is the switched load capacitance, f is frequency, V is voltage


**Static power:** In contrary to dynamic power, static power is consumed while there is no circuit activity.It can be characterised as fixed or stationary. In CMOS, it is defined as power consumption due to constant current from VDD to the ground in the absence of switching activity.

**Short-circuit power:** Short circuit power refers to the theoritical current that will run in the event of a short circuit without protection.It can be found by the following formula:

**Leakage:** It consists of subthreshold and gate leakage.
